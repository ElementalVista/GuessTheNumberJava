# Guess the Number Game

## Overview
This is a simple number-guessing game implemented in Java. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback to help the user find the correct number.

## How It Works
1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The user is prompted to guess the number.
3. The program evaluates the user's guess:
   - If the guess is **too low**, the program displays "Too Low."
   - If the guess is **too high**, the program displays "Too High."
   - If the guess is **outside the range 1-100**, the program alerts the user to enter a valid number.
4. The user continues guessing until they find the correct number.
5. Once the correct number is guessed, the program displays a congratulatory message: "That's the correct number!"

## Features
- Random number generation ensures a unique experience each time the game is played.
- Input validation to ensure guesses are within the range of 1 to 100.
- Feedback for every guess to guide the player.

## How to Play
1. Run the program in your favorite Java IDE or terminal.
2. Follow the prompt to guess a number between 1 and 100.
3. Continue guessing based on the feedback provided until you find the correct number.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- A Java IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans) or terminal to execute the program
